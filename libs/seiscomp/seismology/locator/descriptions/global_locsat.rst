LOCSAT is a locator with a travel-time interface in |scname| for computing
source time and hypocenter coordinates from phase picks considering:

* Pick time and pick uncertainty,
* Backazimuth and backazimuth uncertainty,
* Slowness and slowness uncertainty,
* Phase-specfic travel-time tables.

The LOCSAT :ref:`locator interface <locsat_li>` implements a wrapper for the
LocSAT locator by :cite:t:`bratt-1991` (according to the README file shipped
with the LocSAT distribution) referred to as **LOCSAT** in |scname|. The LOCSAT
:ref:`travel-time interface <locsat_tti>` provides travel time for specfic
phases, epicentral distance, soure depth and station elevation.


.. _locsat_li:

Locator Interface
=================

LOCSAT provides the hypocenter parameters through the locator interface. Instead
of specifying an Earth model, LOCSAT queries travel times via the
:ref:`LOCSAT travel-time interface <locsat_tti>` which makes use of
:ref:`pre-defined travel-time tables <locsat_ttt>`. Note the
:ref:`limitations <locsat_tt>`.

Use "LOCSAT" as a value for the locator interface along with a profile when
configurable, e.g., by :ref:`scolv`, :ref:`scautoloc` or :ref:`screloc`.


.. _locsat_tti:

Travel-Time Interface
=====================

LOCSAT provides an interface for computing travel times based on station and
source coordinates with non-negative source depths. Note the
:ref:`limitations <locsat_tt>`.

The travel times are used for predicting phase arrival times in various
applications such as :ref:`scautoloc` or :ref:`scolv`. The times are visualized,
e.g., as blue marks in the :ref:`scolv picker window <scolv-sec-waveform-review>`.

Use "LOCSAT" as a value for the travel-time interface when configurable, e.g.,
by :ref:`global_fixedhypocenter` or :ref:`global_stdloc`.


.. _locsat_ttt:

Travel-Time Tables
==================

|scname| ships with two sets of predefined travel-time tables which are
made available as the profiles tab and iasp91.

The default profile is *iasp91*.

LOCSAT travel time tables are located as plain ascii files under
:file:`@DATADIR@/locsat/tables/`.
The tables provide the travel times for particular seismic phases at
given depth and epicentral distance in one file per Earth model and seismic
phase. E.g. P-wave arrival times in the iasp91 model are found in
:file:`@DATADIR@/locsat/tables/iasp91.P`. You may easily add your own tables
for any available Earth model and seismic phase by adopting existing ones in new
files which are added by :ref:`configuration <locsat_station_application>` to
your |scname| modules.


Limitations
-----------

#. The source depth is limited to non-negative values up to 800 km.
#. Only phases for which a travel-time table exists can be considered.
#. LOCSAT currently considers travel-time tables for phases which are hard-coded

   * seismic body waves: P, Pb, Pg, Pn, pP, PP, PcP, PKiKP, PKIKP, PKKP, PKP,
     PKPab, PKPbc, PKPdf, pPKPab, pPKPbc, pPKPdf,

     S, Sb, Sg, Sn, sP, sS, SS, ScP, ScS, SKKP, SKP, SKPdf, SKS, SKSac, SKSdf,
     sPKPab, sPKPbc, sPKPdf,

     where P and S are the frist-arrival direct P and S phases, respectively, at
     all distances no matter the take-off angle at the source.
   * seismic surface waves: LQ, LR, Lg, Rg.
   * infrasound: Is, It, Iw.

#. The maximum number of distance and depth intervals per table file is
   currently 210 and 50, respectively.

   .. warning::

      * Travel-time tables with larger numbers of distance or depth samples are
        reported along with command-line error output (stderr). The travel-time
        tables should therefore be tested, e.g., with :ref:`scolv` before
        unsupervised application.
      * Travel times at distance and depth samples exceeding the limits are
        ignored. This may lead to undesired behavior during location.
      * Phase picks observed outside the distance and depth ranges defined by
        travel-time tables may lead to undesired behavior during location.

#. The considered minimum depth is 0 km. Elevations and depths above datum are
   not natively considered. The effects of station elevation can be
   :ref:`empirically corrected for<locsat_station_elevation>`.


.. _locsat_station_elevation:

Station elevations
------------------

LOCSAT does not natively support corrections of travel times for station
elevations. At least checking the code:

.. code-block:: c

   sta_cor[i]  = 0.0;    /* FIX !!!!!!*/

However, the |scname| wrapper adds this feature. It allows to define a
:file:`.stacor` file which defines emperic corrections of observed travel times.
The corrections are provided in seconds and **subtracted** (not added) from
the observation time to be compatible with the NonLinLoc :cite:p:`nonlinloc`
station correction definitions.

Each LOCSAT profile (travel time table) can have one associated station
correction file. E.g. for adding station corrections to the iasp91 tables, the
file :file:`$SEISCOMP_ROOT/share/locsat/tables/iasp91.stacor` needs to be
created.

Station correction files take the form (example):

.. code-block:: properties

   # LOCDELAY code phase numReadings delay
   LOCDELAY GE.MORC P 1 0.15
   LOCDELAY IU.ANMO.00 P 1 0.36
   LOCDELAY IU.KONO.20 P 1 -0.03

with

- **LOCDELAY**: Required fixed string.
- **code** (*string*): Stream code (after all alias evaluations) up to sensor
  location code with network and station code as a minium. Exception: If only
  a station code is given, then only the station code is checked. This is a
  fallback for data centers ignoring network codes and should be used
  exceptionally only.

  Network, station and
  sensor location codes are separated by '.'. If no sensor location is given, an
  empty code is assumed. Wildcards are not supported.
- **phase** (*string*): Phase type (any of the available travel time tables)
- **numReadings** (*integer*): Number of residuals used to calculate mean
  residual/delay. Not used by LOCSAT, included for compatibility reasons with
  :ref:`NonLinLoc <global_nonlinloc>`
- **delay** (*float*): Delay in seconds, subtracted from observed time.

.. note::

   * Station corrections are only considered by the locator, not the travel-time
     interface. Therefore, they do not find application for locating by
     :ref:`global_fixedhypocenter` or for phase association in :ref:`scautoloc`.
   * The example file for station corrections above reflect the format not any
     empirically derived relationship and the values themselves have no meaning.


.. _locsat_station_application:

Application and Setup
=====================

LOCSAT is the default and only locator for :ref:`scautoloc` with *iasp91* as the
default profile. However, LOCSAT can be used optionally in other modules such as
:ref:`scolv` or :ref:`screloc`.


.. _locsat_custom-ttt:

Custom travel-time tables
-------------------------

#. Generate your travel-time tables from a custom Earth model, depth and
   distance intervals. Use the same format as the defaults as the *iasp91*
   tables. Tools such as :cite:t:`taup` allow the generation.
#. Add your custom travel-time tables along with station corrections to
   :file:`@DATADIR@/locsat/tables/`
#. Add your available custom LOCSAT travel-time tables in global configuration,
   e.g., to the list of tables of travel-time interfaces

   .. code-block:: properties

      ttt.LOCSAT.tables = iasp91, tab, custom

   and to the list of locator profiles

   .. code-block:: properties

      LOCSAT.profiles = iasp91, tab, custom

   and optionally to locators which make use of LOCSAT tables, e.g.,
   :ref:`global_fixedhypocenter`.


Application with modules
------------------------

Additional parameters of LOCSAT may be configured in global module configuration
(:confval:`LOCSAT.*`).

* The profiles for locating may be extended or limited by
  :confval:`LOCSAT.profiles`.
* When using picks with time uncertainties, consider
  :confval:`LOCSAT.usePickUncertainties` and :confval:`LOCSAT.defaultTimeError`.
* Measurements of backazimuth and slowness may be deactivated by
  :confval:`LOCSAT.useBackazimuth` and :confval:`LOCSAT.useSlownewss`, respectively.
  Such measurements may be obtained from array processing or from feature
  extraction using :ref:`scautopick`.

You may also configure some |scname| modules with LOCSAT and a profile.

* :ref:`scautoloc`: Configure a profile for automatic locations,
* :ref:`screloc`: Configure *LOCSAT* along with a profile for automatically
  relocating.
* :ref:`scolv`: Configure *LOCSAT* along with a profile  as defaults for
  interactive locations.

When using LOCSAT in :ref:`scolv` you may interactively some settings. The
changes only apply during runtime.
